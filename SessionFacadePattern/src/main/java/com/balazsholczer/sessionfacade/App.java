/**
 * Session Facade Pattern: provides coarse-grained facade over fine-grained business objects
 * 
 * Key Concepts:
 * - Wraps multiple fine-grained business objects into single coarse-grained interface
 * - Reduces network calls in distributed systems
 * - Manages transactions and coordinates business logic
 * - Provides simplified interface for complex business workflows
 * 
 * Structure:
 * - SessionFacade: provides coarse-grained business interface
 * - BusinessObjects: fine-grained business logic components
 * - Client: uses SessionFacade instead of individual business objects
 * 
 * Benefits:
 * - Reduces network overhead in distributed systems
 * - Simplifies client interaction with business tier
 * - Centralizes transaction management
 * - Provides atomic business operations
 * 
 * Use Cases:
 * - J2EE applications with EJB session beans
 * - Microservices with complex business workflows
 * - Distributed systems requiring transaction coordination
 * - Enterprise applications with multiple business services
